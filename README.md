## Python Binding for OSVR - "OSVR-Python"
The Blender integration is based on the [OSVR-Python][] Python binding for OSVR, which is maintained in a separate repository. That code is entirely Blender-independent so it can be used in other applications/frameworks.

## OSVR Blender integration
We are currently maintaining support for Blender 2.76 and Python 3.x in this tree.

Note that if you're looking at the source, you'll need to download and import the Pythonic-OSVR project artifacts, see below.
